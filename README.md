# How to programmatically select the dates in the Flutter Calendar?

A quick-start example to help you to programmatically select the dates in the Flutter Calendar.

You can programmatically select the date in the Flutter Event Calendar by using the CalendarController's [selectedDate](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/CalendarController/selectedDate.html) property.

In this sample by using [onViewChanged](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/calendar/callbacks#view-changed-callback) callback of the Flutter event calendar, the first date of visible dates is set as the selected date.
